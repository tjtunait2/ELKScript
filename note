Beats:
A key characteristic of modern IT environments is that useful data is generated
everywhere. Appliances sitting on the edge of your network can have important metrics
to capture; a fleet of frontend, backend, and database servers can generate critical
error or warning logs, and the application your customer runs can generate in-depth
instrumentation and tracing related to application performance bottlenecks you care
about. Data is not only dispersed across the environment but is also varied in terms of the
nature of the information, how it's structured, and how it should be collected.
When data is generated, it typically will need to be shipped to a centralized logging
platform for search, correlation, and analysis. Beats agents are designed to collect and ship
the data to such a central destination.
